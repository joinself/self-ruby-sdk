# QR based authentication request

A Self user will be authenticated on your platform by scanning a QR code and accepting the authentication request on his phone.

As part of this process, you have to share the generated QR code with your users, and wait for a response

## Running this example

In order to run this example, you must have a valid app keypair. Self-keypairs are issued by [Self Developer portal](https://developer.selfid.net/) when you create a new app.

Once you have your valid `SELF_APP_ID` and `SELF_APP_SECRET` you can run this example with:

```bash
$ bundle install
$ SELF_APP_ID=XXXXX SELF_APP_SECRET=XXXXXXXX rackup
```

Open your browser on http://127.0.0.1:9292/ and scan the presented code. Once you accept the request on your phone check your command line for a line like.

```
 User is now authenticated ðŸ¤˜
```

1. Generate Self authentication request QR code
2. Share generated QR code with your user
3. The user scans the Self authentication request QR code
4. The user sends back a signed approved response
